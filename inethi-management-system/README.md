# iNethi User and Service Management Service
## Overview
This repo contains a user management API that stores user payment and service related information. Authentication
for services is handled by Keycloak. Details on this can be found in the ```single-sign-on``` folder. Additionally, a 
payment portal built with React is the final component of this system.
